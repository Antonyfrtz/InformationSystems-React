# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project works in conjunction with https://github.com/Antonyfrtz/InformationSystems-NetCoreAPI by making api calls, so they should be run together (can be done automatically 
through the Visual Studio 2022 template). 

You will need to create a .env file for your financial modelling prep API key (paste without brackets), obtainable here:
https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/
```
VITE_API_KEY={YOURKEY}
```
